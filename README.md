## About :virgo:

Hello, I'm Braulio Aguilar, Web Developer with more than 5 years of experience in Backend, for the last 2 years I have been working with Golang which I'm passionate about. :metal:

Additionally, I have learned to work with approaches such as Microservices, REST API, gRPC, GraphQL, among others.

There are many topics that I have enjoyed learning: AWS, Hashicorp Vault, Docker, Terraform, SCRUM and now I want to start the paths of Rust, DevOps :computer:

I like being sociable, traveling and working as a homeoffice. I have to master English better, but Spanish is good for me. :nail_care:
